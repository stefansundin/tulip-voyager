**Lilium Voyager** is a fork of [ioquake3](https://github.com/ioquake/ioq3) for running _Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force Holomatch_ (multiplayer). It is based on Thilo Schulz' [ioEF engine](http://thilo.kickchat.com/efport-progress/) (also known as iostvoyHM). The focus for Lilium Voyager is to maintain Elite Force multiplayer support on newer ioquake3 versions.

Differences from ioEF 1.38-rc1 (2011):

  * Player origin rounding is compatible with the original QVMs (x86, x86_64).
  * Fixed "read past end of server message" error after downloading a pk3 using EF 1.2 protocol (24).
  * Network compatible with ioEF 1.37.
  * Dedicated servers are listed on official Raven master server.
  * Client and server use separate config files (from ioq3).
  * Better compatibility with newer operating systems (from ioq3).
  * VoIP uses Opus codec instead of Speex (from ioq3).
  * Support for ioquake3's OpenGL2 renderer.
